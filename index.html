    <p class="paragraph">Within this webpage we will be giving information for those beginning or already in the hobby of Gunpla. A little introduction into this world is firstly to talk a little about where it originates, it is originally from an popular Japanese anime "Gundam Mobile Suits". It is a pioneer in the Mecha suit franchise, which would help make the way for their model scale Gunpla or "Gundam plastic model kits". Through the website we will look at what this hobby is, and how to beggin. Different techniques will be talked about as well as different ways of customizing the model kits. There will also be an area for the materials one will need and how to come across them for this hobby. Lastly we will also speak of the different grades, the scales they come in, and how they all differ.</p>
