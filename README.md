# Gio's Website Code Review & Shenanigans

## Comments / Questions
1. I added comments / questions throughout the code where appropriate.
2. I did not delete any code, but made some adjustments. Please take what you like and discard what you do not.
3. I did not know your project file structure - so I created one.

> Overall - I think this is a great start. Thank you so much for sharing it with me and please let me know if there is anything else I can do to support :)
